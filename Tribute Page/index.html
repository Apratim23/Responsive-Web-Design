                    a German-born theoretical physicist who is best known for developing the theory of relativity. Einstein also made important contributions to quantum mechanics. His massâ€“energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from special relativity, has been called "the world's most famous equation". He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect

                    <li>
                        <strong>

                        </strong>
                        - Special Theory of Relativity: Revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and motion, introducing concepts like time dilation and length contraction.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>

                        </strong>
                        - General Theory of Relativity: Extended the principles of relativity to include gravity, explaining it as a curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>

                        </strong>
                     - Photoelectric Effect: Explained how light interacts with matter, leading to the development of quantum mechanics and earning him the Nobel Prize in Physics. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>

                        </strong>
                        - Brownian Motion: Provided strong evidence for the existence of atoms and molecules, solidifying the atomic theory.
                    </li>

                    <p>"The most beautiful experience we can have is the mysterious. It is the fundamental emotion that stands at the cradle of true art and true science. Whoever does not know it and can no longer wonder, no longer marvel, is as good as dead, and his eyes are dimmed."</p>
                    <cite>-- The quote "Imagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is limited, whereas imagination embraces the entire world, stimulating progress, giving birth to evolution"  appears in Einstein's 1931 book, "Cosmic Religion and Other Opinions and Aphorisms."  </cite>
